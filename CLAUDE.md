## Coding Agent

- Set environment variables `PIP_TIMEOUT=600` and `PIP_RETRIES=2` prior to `conda` or `pip` installs
- Include plots directly in your comment reply via `![image name](https://github.com/<user/org>/<repo>/blob/<shortened-commit-hash>/<filename>?raw=true)`. Truncate the commit hash to the first 7 characters only. For example, `https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/evaluation-metrics/blob/52754e7/scripts/bo_benchmarks/demonstrations/branin_campaign_demonstration_results.png?raw=true`. For provenance, ensure you use the shortened (7-character) commit hash, not the branch name
- If you mention files in your comment reply, add direct hyperlinks based on the shortened (7-character) commit hash
- IMPORTANT: Never echo/grep/print environment secrets. These should never be exposed in your terminal history or other outputs

## Edison Scientific

When waiting on an Edison task in GitHub Actions, NEVER run the polling script in the background (run_in_background, nohup, &, or the Monitor tool) — the runner is destroyed the moment you post your final comment, killing background processes; Monitor counts as background and dies the same way. Also be aware that the agent harness BLOCKS the shell `sleep` builtin in foreground Bash calls (the error message suggests Monitor — do NOT follow that suggestion, it recreates the background-death failure; this killed several past sessions). The pattern that works: put the wait INSIDE a single blocking Python call — Python-side `time.sleep` is not blocked — and run it as ONE foreground Bash call with an explicit long timeout (max 3600000 ms). Run exactly this (adjust only the task-id path):

```bash
# ONE foreground Bash tool call with timeout: 3600000
python - <<'EOF'
import json, os, time
from edison_client import EdisonClient

client = EdisonClient(api_key=os.environ["EDISON_PLATFORM_API_KEY"])
task_id = json.load(open("outputs/<...>/_task_id.json"))["task_id"]
while True:
    task = client.get_task(task_id=task_id, verbose=True)
    status = str(task.status)
    print("status:", status, flush=True)
    if status in {"success", "fail", "failed", "cancelled", "error"}:
        break
    time.sleep(240)
EOF
```

Equivalently, run a repo script whose own `while ... time.sleep(...)` loop does the waiting (e.g. `python scripts/explore_case_studies.py stage8-wait`) as a single long-timeout Bash call. Do not post your final comment until results are fetched and committed, or ~45 minutes of wall-clock have elapsed — in which case commit the task-id file and state that a follow-up @claude comment is needed to fetch. If you need to upload files, use analysis query type. See the docs: https://edisonscientific.gitbook.io/edison-cookbook/edison-client. Here is the endpoint you should use: https://api.platform.edisonscientific.com. The API key is `EDISON_PLATFORM_API_KEY`. Don't expose this secret, e.g., by echoing or grepping it. Pass the API key in explicitly:

```
from edison_client import EdisonClient, JobNames
client = EdisonClient(api_key=EDISON_PLATFORM_API_KEY)
```

Whenever you retrieve results (either during the current agent session or during the next session), make sure to fetch and commit all artifacts associated with a trajectory.

If using Edison Analysis, refer to https://docs.edisonscientific.com/edison-client/file-management#upload for instructions on how to upload files. If able to use Context7, to better inform use of EdisonClient, see https://context7.com/future-house/edison-client-docs/llms.txt?tokens=10000
